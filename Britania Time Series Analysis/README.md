# 📈 Stock Price Forecasting of Britannia Using MA and ARMA Models

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting the stock prices of Britannia Industries using Time Series Analysis techniques. The study applies Moving Average (MA) and AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models to predict future stock prices and evaluate forecasting performance.

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, stationarity testing, forecasting model development, performance evaluation, and future stock price prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze historical Britannia stock price data.
- Perform time series preprocessing.
- Check stationarity using the ADF Test.
- Develop Moving Average (MA) models.
- Develop AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models.
- Forecast future stock prices.
- Compare model performance using RMSE.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

### Stock Price Trend
Analyzes the historical movement of Britannia stock prices.

### Rolling Mean and Standard Deviation
Used to check stationarity visually.

### ADF Test
Determines whether the time series is stationary.

---

## 🤖 Models Used

### Moving Average (MA)

Moving Average forecasting predicts future values based on the average of previous observations.

Models Tested:

- MA(1)
- MA(2)
- MA(3)

### AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA)

ARMA combines:

- AutoRegression (AR)
- Moving Average (MA)

It uses both previous observations and past forecast errors.

---

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | RMSE |
|---------|---------|
| MA(1) | 3356.81 |
| MA(2) | 3356.17 |
| MA(3) | 3355.43 |

### Best MA Model

✅ **MA(3)**

Reason: Lowest RMSE value.

---

## 📉 Forecasting Results

The developed MA and ARMA models were used to forecast future stock prices based on historical patterns.

Forecasts help investors and analysts understand potential future price movements and market trends.

---

## 🏆 Key Findings

- Historical stock data was successfully analyzed.
- Stationarity was achieved through preprocessing techniques.
- MA(3) produced the lowest RMSE among MA models.
- ARMA provided a more advanced forecasting framework.
- Forecasting models can assist in stock market decision-making.
